## üõ°Ô∏è Notes & Best Practices

- All advanced projects should **only be run in a lab/test environment**.  
- Follow cybersecurity ethics and safe coding practices.  
- Scripts are designed for **learning purposes** and portfolio demonstration.

## üìå Skills & Knowledge Gained

- Python fundamentals: variables, loops, functions, OOP  
- File handling, regex, and JSON data processing  
- Networking with sockets and Scapy  
- Security concepts: hashing, password strength, log parsing, encryption  
- API integration and automation scripting
